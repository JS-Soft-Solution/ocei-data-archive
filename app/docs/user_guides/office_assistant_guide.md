## Workflow Overview

```
DATA ENTRY OPERATOR
    ↓ Submit
YOU (Office Assistant)
    ↓ Approve                ↘ Reject
SECRETARY                    ↓
    ↓ Final Approve          BACK TO OPERATOR
APPROVED ✅                  (They resubmit to you)
```

**Note:** If Secretary rejects, it goes directly back to operator and skips you next time.

---

## After You Approve

1. Application status changes to **"Submitted to Secretary"**
2. Secretary reviews for final approval
3. Your verification is logged in audit trail
4. Application leaves your pending queue

---

## Handling Re-submissions

If an operator resubmits after your rejection:
- It appears in your pending queue again
- You can see previous rejection reason in history
- Check if they actually fixed the issues
- If not fixed properly, reject again with more detail
